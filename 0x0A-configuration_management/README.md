## PUPPET

- OVERVIEW

Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool designed to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of IT infrastructure. It allows system administrators to define the desired state of their infrastructure using code, known as Puppet manifests, which Puppet then enforces across all systems in the environment.

## PUPPET AS A TOOL FOR WORK

Puppet, a tool that has significantly simplified the life of system administrators and engineers by automating the management of multiple servers' configuration. Puppet uses a declarative language to define the desired state of the system's configuration, which it then enforces on the target machines. It's a bit like telling a group of robots exactly how you want your room arranged, and then watching them do all the work to make it happen just as you described.

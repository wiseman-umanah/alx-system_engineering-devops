Firewalls: These act as a barrier between the internal network and the outside world. They monitor incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking or permitting data packets based on a set of security rules. This helps prevent unauthorized access and protects both the client and server from potential threats like cyberattacks.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): SSL is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This ensures that all data transmitted between the web server and browsers remains private and integral. When data is sent from the client to the server, it is encrypted. Once it reaches the server and passes the necessary security checks, it is decrypted. The same process applies when data is sent back to the client. This encryption-decryption process secures the data transmission, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and understand the data.

Monitoring Clients: These are tools or systems used to continuously monitor the health and performance of the network. They can track various metrics like server load, network traffic, application performance, etc. Monitoring clients act as a diagnostic tool, providing insights and alerts about the network's status. This helps in identifying potential issues before they cause system failures or disruptions. Effective monitoring ensures that the network and its components function optimally and reliably.

In thiis web infrastructure design, firewalls, monitoring clients and ssl is beung added to the web frame.
This is to secure and encryot data gotten from the client and back to the client to avoid hackers or people that may try to use the site without authorization.
The firewalls block unusual access and corrupted data from leaving or coming to the client and server side thereby protecting the interest and data of the client and servers.
SSL is a kind of digital certification that makes the network interface between the client and the server secured. When data is parsed from the client to the server, it gets encrypted. After passing the necessary checks, the data is then decrypted in the server side it access key to validate access to a particular information/data. The useful information gotten from the server side is then encryted back to the client side and decrypted there. This makes a secured connection between the client and the server.
Hackers find it almost impossible to breach the network due to the security checks, firewalls and the requirements of the network beforegiving out information to the client

The monitoring client gets data and useful information about the network's health. They can be seen as network doctors or reporters that gives feedback whether the network is all good or a system will fail due to some unforeseen reasons. This is very necessary in the creation of networks so that network functionality remains in its best form.

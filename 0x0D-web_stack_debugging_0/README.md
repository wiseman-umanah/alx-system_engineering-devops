### WEB DEBUGGING

This is a cool project to research and understand the intricacies of debugging the web servers and also to grasp the nature of our web server problem comes

This project leads to the understanding of Apache and Docker usage.

## Docker
Docker is a fascinating and transformative technology that has revolutionized how we develop, deploy, and run applications. At its core, Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

Containers and Their Magic
Imagine containers as lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages. These packages include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and system tools. What makes containers truly remarkable is their ability to run across any Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X operating system on any infrastructure, be it a personal laptop, a physical server, or the cloud. This ensures that developers can work in a standardized environment, thereby significantly reducing the "it works on my machine" syndrome.

## Apache
Apache in a Docker container is a graceful way to ensure that your web server environment is both portable and consistent across any system Docker can run on. This approach simplifies the deployment and scaling of web applications.

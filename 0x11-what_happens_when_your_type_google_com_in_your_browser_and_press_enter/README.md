Web infrastructure design is a critical aspect of developing and maintaining robust, scalable, and efficient web services and applications. It involves the selection and arrangement of hardware and software systems that support the web environment. A well-designed web infrastructure considers several components such as servers, storage, networking, and security protocols. The servers may include web servers, application servers, and database servers that work together to handle client requests and deliver content.

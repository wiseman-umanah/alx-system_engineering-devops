## WEB_STACK MONITORING

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics tool for information technology (IT) and DevOps teams that can be used to determine performance metrics as well as Event monitoring for infrastructure and cloud services. The software can monitor services such as servers, databases and tools.

## APPLICATION MONITORING

Application performance management (APM) is the monitoring and management of the performance and availability of software applications. APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service. APM is "the translation of IT metrics into business meaning ([i.e.] value).


## SERVER MONITORING

Server monitoring involves overseeing and managing the performance, security, and availability of servers, particularly those deployed in the cloud. The process aims to prevent failures that could disrupt service by tracking various key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the server type, such as responsiveness for application servers, speed for web servers, and data throughput for storage servers. Effective server monitoring involves identifying critical KPIs, setting baseline values, configuring data collection and analysis, establishing alert systems, and defining response protocols. This helps maintain operational efficiency, ensure security, and reduce downtime across multiple server types, including web, application, and network servers.
